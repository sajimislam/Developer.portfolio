                applications
                to be accessed through the Internet. These websites and apps have specific features and functions that
                the
                dev is responsible to build through his programming skills.</p>

            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>Web developers are at the forefront of the Internet age. The websites we browse, the gifts we order and
                the news we peruse online are all made possible by the web developers who design, build and implement
                Internet websites. They are heavily involved in website creation, from helping design aesthetic
                properties such as layout and color, to technical considerations such as how to design a website to
                handle a given amount of Internet traffic.

                <p>Web developers work independently as freelancers or with company teams to create websites. Depending
                    on
                    the job, these professionals may focus on front-end development, which involves designing sites and
                    producing content, or back-end development, which involves writing code to make website features
                    work.

                <p>Junior developers are inexperienced. Some just graduated and are starting their first full-time job.
                    The
                    mindset of a junior developer often is to just make the code work. Working software and good
                    software
                    are considered the same. Programming straightforward code is hard.</p>
