                to be accessed through the Internet. These websites and apps have specific features and functions that

            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>Web developers are at the forefront of the Internet age. The websites we browse, the gifts we order and
                the news we peruse online are all made possible by the web developers who design, build and implement
                Internet websites. They are heavily involved in website creation, from helping design aesthetic
                properties such as layout and color, to technical considerations such as how to design a website to
                handle a given amount of Internet traffic.
